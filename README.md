# Intermediate Gatsby with Gatsby Themes
This is a repository I created to accompany my viewing of [Intermediate Gatsby with Gatsby Themes](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-intermediate).

## Start the theme-dev site
Run `yarn workspace theme-dev develop` to start the theme-dev site in `develop` mode. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser. Open [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) in your browser to interact with [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

You can use the theme-dev site to test the gatsby-theme-docs theme.
